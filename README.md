## Purpose

Implements a number of "missing" recipes, as well as more ways to recover materials. Aims to minimize changes in gameplay and game balance, while making it easier to acquire and recover resources.

This is intended to complement my no-monster-minecraft data pack, which contains additional recipes for acquiring hostile mob drops. For best results, I recommend using them together.

## Recipes

#### White Banner/Bed/Carpet/Wool

See "Bleaching".

### Smelting & Blasting

#### Charcoal

Finally, a use for poisonous potatoes! Blasting a potato or poisonous potato in a blast furnace makes charcoal.

This is based on an incident when I was 10, when I accidentally set a potato on fire in the microwave, producing charcoal (and destroying the microwave). Oops!

#### Gold

It is now easier to recover gold from some items.

Smelting or blasting gold horse armor, totem of undying, or a bell now yields
a gold ingot (instead of a gold nugget).

#### Iron

It is now easier to recover iron from some items.

Smelting or blasting an iron door, iron trapdoor, iron horse armor,
or a minecart, hopper, smithing table, or cauldron yields an iron ingot
(instead of an iron nugget).

Smelting or blasting any anvil yields an iron block.

### Stonecutter

You can use the stonecutter to recover some resources.

#### Diamonds

Placing any diamond tool (except a shovel), armor piece, or jukebox on a
stonecutter yields one diamond; diamond horse armor yields three diamonds.

#### Leather

You can also recover one leather from any leather armor on the stonecutter; you can get three leather from leather horse armor or a saddle.

#### Netherite

Placing any netherite tool or armor piece on a stonecutter yields two netherite scrap.

Placing a lodestone on a stonecutter yields one netherite ingot.
