Dedicated to Tacoder.

## Purpose

Implements a number of "missing" recipes, as well as more ways to recover
materials. Aims to minimize changes in gameplay and game balance, while
making it easier to acquire and recover resources.

This is intended to complement my no-monster-minecraft data pack, which contains
additional recipes for acquiring hostile mob drops. For best results,
I recommend using them together.

### Smelting & Blasting

#### Bottle o' Enchanting

Ever wonder how the clerics make those bottles of pure experience? Wonder
no more! You can make these too, by putting dragon breath in a furnace.
Quite a bit of extra experience also "leaks out" into the furnace itself,
so be sure you take it out yourself instead of using a hopper!

![Bottle o' Enchanting](img/bottle_o_enchanting.png)

But of course, now we must wonder how the clerics get the dragon's breath...

#### Charcoal

Finally, a use for poisonous potatoes! Blasting a potato or poisonous potato
in a blast furnace makes charcoal.

![Charcoal](img/charcoal.png)
![Charcoal](img/charcoal2.png)

This is based on an incident when I was 10, when I accidentally set a potato
on fire in the microwave, producing charcoal (and destroying the microwave). Oops!

#### Leather

You can smelt rotten flesh into leather.
